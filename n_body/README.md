In this project, I simulated the movements of a number of objects in space (the 'n-body problem'). <br />
<br />
In this code, I refered and modified from these 2 sources. <br />
1) https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/33design/vector.py.html; <br /> 
2) https://gist.github.com/benrules2/856d4151573a1408eac23da83851495f <br />
The reasons why I decided to do this are:
1) source #1 has the credibility yet lacks the use of popular graphing library (they used their own internal library) <br /> 
2) source #2 uses popular graphing library yet lacks the leverage of OOP in their code <br /> 
<br />
Hopefully after running this Python program, you'll have a better visualization of the movements of our Solar system's planets! <br />
