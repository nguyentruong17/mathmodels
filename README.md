# mathmodels
I took a course at my college named "Math Modeling". In this class, we studied and coded up some well-established models with Python. <br />
In this repository, however, are some selective models that I personally liked and may not reflect what truly went on in the class. <br />
If you are now, or in the future, a student of the same class at the same college, please feel free to use my code as references. <br />
If you are not, please feel free to use the code to run your simulations of any purpose. I will make sure to keep the code does what it should.
